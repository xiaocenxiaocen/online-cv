        company: NVIDIA, Beijing
        details: |
          Develop and maintain the low-level deep learning tensor library. Explore flexible
          code generation technologies.  
            - Designed a tile based kernel fusion framework that can fuse memory-bounded operators
            into a compute-intensive operator, such as Gemm and Convolution. 
            - Implemented functionalities of delivering jitted configurable and composable Gemm kernels 
            to cover long-tail cases and reduce binary size.
            - Implemented functionalities of Gemm Softmax fusion and Gemm Layernorm fusion based on the 
            kernel fusion framework. 
      - role: Senior Deep Learning System Architect

        company: Megvii, Beijing
        details: |
          Develop and maintain the open-source deep learning framework, MegEngine. Optimize the E2E
          performance of deep learning workloads on NVIDIA GPUs. 
            - Developed the performant 4-bit integer quantized convolution kernels based on CUTLASS. 
            - Deployed 4-bit integer quantized CNNs in real-world productions. 
            - Optimized the 4-bit integer quantized network, achieving 1.3x speedup over the 8-bit integer 
            TensorRT quantized network with the same structure. 
            - Improved the precision of a real-world production network by 1% to 3% by using 4-bit integer 
            quantization, ensuring the same QPS as the 8-bit quantized network.
            - Developed the performant depthwise convolution kernels based on CUTLASS, including forward, 
            backward data, and backward weight operators. 
            - The implementation was used by the CVPR 2022 paper, Scaling Up Your Kernels to 31x31: 
            Revisiting Large Kernel Design in CNN. 
            - Reduced the training time of the large kernel network in the above paper by 50% by using the 
            optimized depthwise convolution kernels.
